              <p>
                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer and
                anti-colonial nationalist who employed non-violent resistance in
                the campaign for India’s independence from British Born in 1869
                in Gujarat, India, Gandhi studied law at the Inner Temple in
                London.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p1>
                After unsuccessfully attempting to practise in India, he moved
                to South Africa in 1893, where he stayed for 21 years. It was in
                South Africa that Gandhi first used tactics of non-violent
                resistance to campaign for civil rights. This activism gained
                Gandhi the title Mahatma, meaning ‘great soul’.
              </p1>

            <li>
              <p3
                >When Gandhi returned to India in 1915 he led campaigns to
                improve the lives of India’s peasants, farmers and labourers. He
                also popularised his concept of non-violent resistance, which
                became known in India as satyagraha, a Sanskrit and Hindi word
                meaning ‘holding onto truth’.
              </p3>
            </li>

                >It includes civil disobedience methods such as boycotts and
                strikes, but also the complete rejection of any form of
                violence, even in self-defence. Gandhi showed his support for
                India’s rural poor by rejecting Western dress for the
                traditional dhoti and living a simple and self-sufficient
                lifestyle. He also frequently practised fasting as a means of
                self-reflection and political protest. Gandhi became involved in
                Indian politics in 1919 and aligned himself with the Indian
                National Congress. He became leader of the Congress in 1921, but
                chose to retire from the party in 1934 when his colleagues
                failed to fully embrace satyagraha
              </p4>

              <p5
                >While many people supported Gandhi and his teachings, some
                Hindus believed that he was too supportive of Pakistan and
                Indian Muslims. Such views led militant Hindu nationalist
                Nathuram Godse to assassinate Gandhi at an inter-faith prayer
                meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi’s death was mourned
                across the nation, with over one million people joining his
                five-mile-long funeral procession. Today, his birthday is
                commemorated in India as a national holiday and worldwide as the
                International Day of Non-Violence. Further information about the
                life of Gandhi can be found at the Oxford Dictionary of National
                Biography.</p5
